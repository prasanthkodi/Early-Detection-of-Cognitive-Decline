# Early-Detection-of-Cognitive-Decline

This project focuses on developing machine learning models for the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease, leveraging advanced techniques such as Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Autoencoder and Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FFNN). By analyzing a comprehensive dataset from NACC, the study identifies early indicators of cognitive decline. Results highlight the potential of these models in improving early diagnosis and healthcare interventions for Alzheimer’s.
